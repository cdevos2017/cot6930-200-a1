    "\n",
    "Prompt Template Prompting refers to a technique where predefined templates are used to construct effective prompts that guide large language models (LLMs) to generate responses tailored to specific use cases. The templates typically contain static text combined with dynamic input variables, allowing for consistent, reusable, and customizable prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt templates are widely used across various domains, such as:\n",
    "* **Question Generation**: Templates can generate quiz questions by filling in variables related to topics.\n",
    "* **Text Summarization**: Static instructions combined with variable documents or inputs allow flexible summarization.\n",
    "* **Coding Assistance**: Dynamic prompts help LLMs generate code snippets for different programming tasks.\n",

      "The atmospheric condition responsible for the blue appearance of the sky is Rayleigh scattering, which occurs when sunlight interacts with tiny molecules and aerosol particles in the Earth's atmosphere.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rayleigh scattering is a process where shorter (blue) wavelengths of light are scattered more than longer (red) wavelengths by the tiny molecules of gases such as nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2). This scattering effect is named after British physicist Lord Rayleigh, who first described it in the late 19th century.\n",
      "\n",
      "When sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere, it encounters these tiny molecules and aerosol particles. The shorter blue wavelengths are scattered in all directions, while the longer red wavelengths pass through the atmosphere with less scattering. This is why the sky appears blue during the day, as our eyes perceive more of the scattered blue light.\n",
      "\n",
      "The amount of scattering that occurs depends on several factors, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Wavelength: Shorter wavelengths (like blue and violet) are scattered more than longer wavelengths (like red and orange).\n",
      "2. Atmospheric conditions: Dust, pollution, and other aerosol particles can scatter light in different ways.\n",
      "3. Altitude: The amount of scattering increases with altitude, which is why the sky appears more intense blue at higher elevations.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, to summarize, Rayleigh scattering by atmospheric particles is the key factor responsible for the blue appearance of the sky!\n",
