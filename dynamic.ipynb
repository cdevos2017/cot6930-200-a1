    "\n",
    "Prompt Template Prompting refers to a technique where predefined templates are used to construct effective prompts that guide large language models (LLMs) to generate responses tailored to specific use cases. The templates typically contain static text combined with dynamic input variables, allowing for consistent, reusable, and customizable prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt templates are widely used across various domains, such as:\n",
    "* **Question Generation**: Templates can generate quiz questions by filling in variables related to topics.\n",
    "* **Text Summarization**: Static instructions combined with variable documents or inputs allow flexible summarization.\n",
    "* **Coding Assistance**: Dynamic prompts help LLMs generate code snippets for different programming tasks.\n",

      "Tidal bore, also known as tidal wave or tidal bore wave, is a rare phenomenon where a tidal bore forms on an ocean river or coastline, often creating a standing wave or rolling wave. The following geological and environmental factors contribute to the occurrence of tidal bores in specific locations like rivers and coastlines:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Tidal range**: A significant tidal range (the difference between high and low tide) is essential for tidal bore formation. This creates a strong gradient of water depth, leading to the formation of a standing wave or rolling wave.\n",
      "2. **River estuary or delta**: Tidal bores often form in river estuaries or deltas where freshwater rivers meet the ocean. The unique geology and sediment composition of these areas can create an ideal environment for tidal bore formation.\n",
      "3. **Ocean currents**: Strong ocean currents, such as those caused by tides, currents, or wind, play a crucial role in shaping the coastal geometry and influencing tidal bore behavior.\n",
      "4. **Coastal geometry**: The shape and orientation of the coastline, including bays, inlets, and headlands, can affect the formation and behavior of tidal bores.\n",
      "5. **Sediment composition**: The type and distribution of sediment in the estuary or delta can influence tidal bore formation and dynamics. For example, sandy or muddy sediments can trap waves, enhancing their energy and causing them to form a standing wave.\n",
      "6. **Water depth**: A narrow coastal area with shallow water depths can lead to tidal bore formation, as the wave cannot escape the confines of the estuary or delta.\n",
      "7. **Wave generation**: Waves generated by wind, storms, or other external factors can contribute to tidal bore formation by introducing energy into the system.\n",
      "\n",
      "Specific locations where tidal bores are known to occur include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Tibet River (China)**: The confluence of the Yarlung Tsangpo and Mekong rivers creates a unique environment for tidal bore formation.\n",
      "2. **Amazon River (South America)**: Tidal bores have been observed in various parts of the Amazon River, particularly in areas with strong ocean currents and high tidal ranges.\n",
      "3. **Ganges River (India)**: The Ganges River estuary is another location where tidal bores are known to occur, influenced by the river's high tidal range and unique geology.\n",
      "4. **Mekong Delta (Vietnam)**: The Mekong Delta's complex network of rivers, canals, and mangrove forests creates an ideal environment for tidal bore formation.\n",
      "5. **Bay of Fundy (Canada)**: This bay is known for its exceptionally high tidal range, which creates a unique environment for tidal bore formation.\n",
      "\n",
      "These locations offer insights into the geological and environmental factors that contribute to tidal bore occurrence in specific contexts. However, it's essential to note that tidal bores are relatively rare events, even in areas with favorable conditions.\n",
